          			<h3>Kenny</h3>
          			<p>Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the endless oscillation of the mind. What starts out as vision soon becomes corroded into a hegemony of greed, leaving only a sense of chaos and the prospect of a new understanding. As spatial replicas become reconfigured through emergent and academic practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the edges of our world.</p>

          			<h3>Queen Gizzard</h3>
          			<p>My work explores the relationship between the body and skateboard ethics. With influences as diverse as Munch and Joni Mitchell, new variations are manufactured from both opaque and transparent layers. I have been fascinated by the essential unreality of the universe. What starts out as yearning soon becomes finessed into a tragedy of greed, leaving only the possibility of a new order.</p>

          			<h3>Hamie</h3>
          			<p>With influences as diverse as Nietzsche and Joni Mitchell, new combinations are generated from both simple and complex layers. Ever since I was a child I have been fascinated by the ephemeral nature of relationships. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corrupted into a tragedy of lust, leaving only a sense of unreality, the prospect of a new understanding and the possibilities of new era.</p>
