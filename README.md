## North East Events Website

The "North East Events" website project, developed during the first year of university as a team project for the web programming module, showcases foundational skills in web development. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features a structured layout with responsive design principles, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. The frontend is styled using CSS, incorporating a grid-based layout and responsive navigation for intuitive user interaction.

The website includes dynamic content such as upcoming events, shows, exhibitions, and featured artists, managed through HTML and CSS for structure and presentation, respectively. JavaScript is utilized minimally for enhancing user interface elements and ensuring smooth transitions. The project demonstrates competence in integrating multimedia elements (images) and providing a cohesive user experience through clear navigation and informative content sections.

This project underscores the ability to collaborate effectively within a team, adhering to project requirements and timelines typical of academic settings. It highlights foundational knowledge of frontend technologies and best practices in web design and development, setting a solid groundwork for advancing skills in future projects and professional endeavors.
