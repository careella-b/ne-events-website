      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <!-- Separator is inserted in order to keep consistency -->
      <hr>
      <!-- Talking about security threats to this website -->
      <p>Security is one of the essential aspects when it comes to the quality of web applications and software (Shah and Patil, 2017). Testing the North East Event regularly is crucial for determining likely attacks, viruses, threats and other vulnerabilities that might pose a danger to this website. As a result of web systems’ complexity, security testing is now a necessary exercise that is included in the development life cycle of websites (Pak, 2018). Web servers and browsers perform multiple tasks on the user’s screen simultaneously. Users gain a remarkable experience in conducting their business, but they are always vulnerable to unauthorised access (Dehalwar et al., 2017). It can be caused by issues such as coding. This type of vulnerability causes attacks like XXS, CSRF, and injection (Sims, 2018). For example, using $_GET instead of $_POST when sending sensitive information from a form to a database. The second type of vulnerability is configuration problems. They are flaws in systems architecture. The risk emerges due to failing to document security goals properly. The third issue is caused by deficiencies in-network or transport layer, leading to a denial of service to the user (Estrada-Jiménez et al., 2017). When dealing with personal information or sensitive data such as bank details or medical records, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) isn’t the best transfer protocol to use as anyone can tap to your conversation and steal your data. Whereas HTTPS is more secure as it encrypts the website, only your browser and the webserver have the key to decrypt it. This prevents the third party to eavesdrop to your conversation. (Adam Walter, 2020)</p>
      
      <!-- Talking about ways to protect this website from threats -->
      <p>There are various ways in which a web browser can be protected; the first is enabling software updates. Updates should be provided by the vendor’s website (Vila, Novakova, and Todorova, 2017). Use and installation of anti-virus software are crucial for fighting risks and vulnerabilities (Al-Mashhadi and Alabiech, 2017). They protect the device from malicious code. Updates are vital to fighting off new attacks (Riaz et al., 2017). Data protection and privacy can be enforced through the authorisation of trusted requesters to a web browser and authentication, which allow access of rightful users (Gupta and Gupta, 2017). Web users can also reduce threats by avoiding unsafe behaviours like insecure file sharing via the Internet (Fernandez, Yoshioka, and Washizaki, 2018). Finally, some privacy laws have been implemented to protect user-information from various vulnerabilities like alteration and being stolen. Data Protection law like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) allows the people in the EU to have more control over their personal data. Under the terms of GDPF, organisations are forced to make sure that personal data is gathered legally and to protect it from being misused and exploitation (Danny Palmer, 2019). </p>
